    <div id="textArea"> <h1 style="align-content: center">STOCK MARKET</h1> A stock market, equity market or share market is the aggregation <br>
                       of buyers and sellers of stocks (also called shares), which represent <br>
                       ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on <br>
                       a public stock exchange, as well as stock that is only traded privately, <br>
                       such as shares of private companies which are sold to investors through equity <br>
                       crowdfunding platforms. Investment in the stock market is most often done via <br>
                       stockbrokerages and electronic trading platforms. Investment is usually made <br>
                       with an investment strategy in mind.</div>
